What is your scene? 
My scene is a campsite someone has set up in a barren forest. 
What kinds of objects did you include?
I had a lot of objects, like trees, rocks, flowers, mushrooms, the tent, etc. 
Did anything inspire you?
I knew I wanted to do something regarding nature. At first I wanted to do an underwater scene but there were not packages for that in the assets store,
so I decided to go for a forest/camp instead
What is the main character in this scene?
The main characters are the little rock formation to the side of the tent. 
List of each object in your scene and how it was acquired (necessary for assigning points)
All objects, including the skybox, were acquired through the Unity asset store.
