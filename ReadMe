What is your scene? 
My scene is a campsite someone has set up in a barren forest. 
What kinds of objects did you include?
I had a lot of objects, like trees, rocks, flowers, mushrooms, the tent, etc. 
Did anything inspire you?
I knew I wanted to do something regarding nature. At first I wanted to do an underwater scene but there were not packages for that in the assets store,
so I decided to go for a forest/camp instead
What is the main character in this scene?
The main characters are the little rock formation to the side of the tent.
